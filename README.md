I am currently building **Ehrlich Inference**, an AI-first engineering company focused on high-performance inference systems and internal automation tooling.  
My work centers on scalable model execution, infrastructure that abstracts complexity rather than creating it, and solutions aimed at technical teams instead of consumers.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Efficient inference pipelines and model-level optimization  
- Secure backend automation and systems integration  
- Minimal, dependable developer tooling for production environments  

Ehrlich Inference is built around an engineering-driven approach: practical systems, stable interfaces, and AI capabilities that serve as infrastructure rather than products.

If you want to discuss collaboration or technical work, feel free to reach out.
